### Milestone 2 Goals : Alpha Release Features
The application will provide a functional core that demonstrates its main purpose, allowing users to interact with book and author data. While some features are not yet complete, users can get a feel for the intended functionality.

For the Alpha Release, the system should be somewhat usable, and users can perform several related tasks:

Author and Book Management:

- Bookstore owners can add new authors and books.
- Books can be associated with multiple authors.

Login functionality:
- Users should be able to login to unique sessions
- Users should be able to have carts
  
Browse Books:
- Users can view the catalog of available books, see details for each book, and filter by various criteria.
  
Navigation and Basic UI:
- Improved navigation and layout, cleaning up the UI that guides users through the available features.
